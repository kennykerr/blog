# Where's my favorite macro from the Windows SDK?

The [windows](https://crates.io/crates/windows) and [windows-sys](https://crates.io/crates/windows-sys) crates are [generated from metadata](how-are-crates-built.md). This metadata only includes type definitions and function signatures, not macros, header-only functions, or function bodies. You may find some equivalents of common C/C++ helper macros and functions in the `windows` crate, but in general the macros don't have direct equivalents in the `windows` or `windows-sys` crates.

In order to aid developers with commonly used macros and functions that are not available, an effort is being made on creating a section of this book with a list of commonly used macros and Rust implementation snippets for them. This list is a work in progress and can be found in the [macro section of this book](../rust-macro-section/readme.md). If there is a macro or header-only function you're missing, feel free to [name it here](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues/2798), [open an issue in this repo](https://github.com/kennykerr/blog/issues/new), or to [fork this mdbook](https://github.com/kennykerr/blog/fork) to add it yourself!
