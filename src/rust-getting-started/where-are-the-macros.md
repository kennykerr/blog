# Where's my favorite macro from the Windows SDK?

The [windows](https://crates.io/crates/windows) and [windows-sys](https://crates.io/crates/windows-sys) crates are [generated from metadata](how-are-crates-built.md). This metadata only includes type definitions and function signatures, not macros, header-only functions, or function bodies. You may find some equivalents of common C/C++ helper macros and functions in the `windows` crate, but in general the macros don't have direct equivalents in the `windows` or `windows-sys` crates. 

Through the years mentions of snippet collections or dedicated crates have been discussed, but never really happened. As of 2024 there was a [formalized request](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues/2798) in which several options were discussed. This led to [a PR](https://github.com/kennykerr/blog/pull/3) that quickly revealed it's not feasible to track all of it in a blog as snippets. Especially considering the maintenance burden, it'd be much better to get set up with one or more crates that would allow for automated testing and CI runs. That crate repo [can be found here](https://github.com/RivenSkaye/windows-rs-ext) and contributions are very much welcome.
